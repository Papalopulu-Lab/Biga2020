For the spatial periodicity analysis in kymographs from untreated conditions:
Unarchive the kymos.zip file then run Kymo_mainmultiextract.m to produce auto-correlation and Lomb-Scargle periodogram measurements of spatial periodicity in the dorsal-to-ventral axis. Values reported are averages per experiment for multiple left and right kymographs collected at different z depth.

For the persistence time analysis in kymographs from untreated conditions:
Unarchive kymos.zip if not already done. Run Kymo_trackbandfixedsize.m then persistence_time_apical.m
