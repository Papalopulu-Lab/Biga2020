# Running the model

The model is written in Matlab. 

To generate a time series of a n x m grid of cells and immediately view outputs of that simulation, run the **MainModel.m** file with all the functions in this repository folder saved 
in the same folder. 

To generate a parameter space, run the **ParameterSpace.m** file.
